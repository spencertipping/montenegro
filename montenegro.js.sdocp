sdocp('montenegro.js.sdoc', 'Montenegro server library | Spencer Tipping\nLicensed under the terms of the MIT source code license\n\nIntroduction.\nMontenegro extends Caterwaul (http://spencertipping.com/caterwaul) to operate in a node.js environment and provide REST web services. It provides asynchronous connectors, stream transformers,\nURL routing, and some other utilities that make non-blocking servers easier to develop.\n\nmontenegro = caterwaul.clone();\n\nAsynchronous connectors.\nNode programs often stream things, but sometimes convert those streams to whole pieces of data. This macro/function layer provides relatively simple ways of doing that.\n');
