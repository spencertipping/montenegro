Montenegro web framework.
Montenegro consists of two files, montenegro.jquery.js and montenegro.js. The former is used on the client-side (as a Caterwaul configuration), and the latter is used on the server-side.

Client-side library.
montenegro.jquery gives you some interesting stuff, perhaps most importantly a syntax for creating markup inside Javascript:

  // Using the montenegro.jquery Caterwaul configuration:
  var element = html<< div.foo.bar('some text', a[href='http://...']('link to wherever'));
  $('body').append(element);

In this example, the following markup is appended to the body:

  <div class='foo bar'>
    some text
    <a href='http://...'>link to wherever</a>
  </div>

The key is the html<< operator, which returns a jQuery-wrapped DOM node. The source code explains all of the syntax used to construct DOM elements.

(More documentation forthcoming as further features are designed)
